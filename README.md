Making pdf's legible on Kindle

This collection of programs uses pypdf to work.
Install pypdf using:
sudo pip install pypdf

There are a number of scripts for different sources. See which one suits you. This helps you in reading books you bought online in *.pdf format on kindle without disturbing any typesetting as usual .mobi formats would do.
It works by tighly sniping the borders and margins that are otherwise meant for paper based books.

How it works(Until i make a user friendly prompt based one):
1.Rename the file to kivy
2.Paste the python (.py) file corresponding to your requirement in the same folder and run it in terminal as
python kindify_xx.py
3.You will see a new file in the directory as kindified output in seconds!
4.Enjoy!

I dont promote book piracy or any illegal activity! Please buy books.. Pen needs ink but the writer needs bread to command the pen.
